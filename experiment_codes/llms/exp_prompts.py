# ValueSpace='''
#    There are three value dimensions: "Active", "Social", "Helpful".
#    The "Active" value dimension measures the individual's energy level and preference for physical motion.
#    The possible scores of "Active" are:
#    0 (inactive) - indicates a complete absence of energy and a preference for no physical activity;
#    0.5 (neutral) - reflects a moderate energy level with no strong preference towards activity or inactivity;
#    1 (active) - signifies high energy level and a strong preference for physical motion.
#
#    The "Social" value dimension assesses the individual's inclination towards social communication and interactions with others.
#    The possible scores of "Social" are:
#    0 (unsocial) - signifies a preference for solitude and avoidance of social interactions;
#    0.5 (neutral) - indicates no strong preference towards being social or unsocial;
#    1 (social): reflects a strong preference for engaging in social communications and interactions with others.
#
#    The "Helpful" value dimension evaluates the individual's propensity to assist others.
#    The possible scores are (Note: There is no neutral value in this dimension):
#    -1 (harmful) - inclined to hinder others from achieving their goals;
#    0 (unhelpful) - shows no interest in helping others;
#    0.5 (neutral) - reflects a moderate willingness to provide help;
#    1 (helpful) - somewhat willing to provide assistance to others;
#    2 (very helpful) - demonstrates a strong willingness to provide help.

POSITION_ROTATE = '''
The coordinate system follows a Cartesian plane, where the x-axis is horizontal, 
pointing to the right, and the y-axis is vertical, pointing upwards. The rotation angle 
starts at the positive x-axis (0Â°), increases counterclockwise (positive angle).
